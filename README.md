# Walkie-Talkie-By-Android-app
This is an android app prototype to use mobile phone as walkie talkie

This can be used to interact with another user by connecting each user to a common wifi network.
This app uses MulticastSocket therefore multiple users can join to this conversation and talk with each other.
